The MS in Transportation Management requires the minimum TOEFL/IELTS score and not the higher scores that we require for all our other programs. It also does not have the preferred GPA of a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.  Can this please be updated on the 2016-2017 form? Would it be helpful to have the 2016-2017 requirements for Transportation Management decoupled from our other programs? \n\nDTI prefers 5-10 years mid-to senior- level management experience (in the transportation field).
